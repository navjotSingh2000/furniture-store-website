					<p class="dark">
						The company is known for its modernist designs for various types of appliances and furniture, and its interior 
						design work is often associated with an eco-friendly simplicity.[19] In addition, the firm is known for its 
						attention to cost control, operational details, and continuous product development that allowed Ind-Furnitures 
						Corp. to lower its prices by an average of two to three percent.
						Most stores follow the layout of having the showroom upstairs with the marketplace and self-service warehouse 
						downstairs. Some stores are single level, while others have separate warehouses to allow more stock to be kept 
						on-site. Single-level stores are found predominantly in areas where the cost of land would be less than the 
						cost of building a 2-level store. Some stores have dual-level warehouses with machine-controlled silos to allow 
						large quantities of stock to be accessed throughout the selling day.

							<h3>Our Objective ...							
							</h3>
							<p>
								To make Ind-Furnitures Corp. a more sustainable company, a product life cycle was created. For the 
								idea stage, products should be flat-packed so that more items can be shipped at once; products 
								should also be easier to dismantle and recycle. Raw materials are used, and since wood and cotton 
								are two of Ind-Furnitures Corp.'s most important manufacturing products, the company works with 
								environmentally friendly forests and cotton, whereby the excessive use of chemicals and water is avoided.

								Ind-Furnitures Corp. stores recycle waste and many run on renewable energy. All employees are trained 
								in environmental and social responsibility, while public transit is one of the priorities when the 
								location of stores is considered. Also, the coffee and chocolate served at Ind-Furnitures Corp. stores 
								is UTZ Certified.The last stage of the life cycle is the end of life. The company is also exploring the 
								recycling of sofas.
